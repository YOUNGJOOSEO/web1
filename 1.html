  <h2>Park Hyo shin이란 누구인가?</h2>
<p>When <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Park_Hyo-shin" target="_blank" title="Park hyo shin speicification">Park</a> was young, he sang trot, <strong>a Korean traditional genre,</strong> at his family's restaurant. The guests liked Park singing, so they visited Park's family restaurant often. Though he was young, many people heard he sang very well so they visited the restaurant to listen to him sing.

</p><p style="margin-top:45px;">He also became a trainee at a Korean entertainment company. However, due to problems that happened in his management company, he moved to another company. Park thought there wouldn't be any problems in this new company, but this company forced Park to pay money because he ignored a sponsor. Due to these issues, Park thought about giving up his dream of being a singer. However, his friend introduced Park to composer Hwang Yoon Min, and he started to sing again under Hwang's supervision.</p>
