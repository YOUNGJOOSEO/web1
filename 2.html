  <h2>Music style</h2>
<p>Park's style of singing had changed over time. As new albums were released, his singing style changed. From his first to fourth album, he used a singing method called the "So-mol-e Method (it means chasing cow Method)".[12] The So-mol-e Method is a Korean R&B singing method that is particularly unique compared to other methods.[13] Seven years after debuting, Park started singing more comfortably, with his natural voice which we can hear in his latest albums.

When Park released his 5th album, his singing style had fully changed. His voice was significantly soft, easy to listen to, and the delivery was better than the Somole Method. People thought that Park's new singing style became similar Eric Benét, and on Interview, Park clarified that Eric Benét was a singer whom he liked and admired and adopted his singing method.[12]

In his song "Shine Your Light", Park employed a sweet and mellow singing style. This song served as a reminder to listeners Park Hyo Shin's nature as someone who listens to his fans and changed according to their concerns.

Park Hyo Shin is considered as being the one of the best Korean singers because of his singing style. He is among the top 4 singers in Korea whom Koreans call "Kim Na Park Lee" , as in Kim Bum Soo, Naul, Park Hyo Shin and Lee Soo.[14]

Due to his introverted personality, Park rarely appears on TV or radio. He prefers to stay at home and doesn't like to go outside.[15]
